# 🫀 Heart Disease Risk Predictor (CLI)

A Python-based command-line tool that estimates the risk of heart disease based on patient health metrics.
Designed to demonstrate **logical data processing** and **conditional algorithms** in Python.

## 🚀 Overview
This project takes user input (Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, etc.) and runs it through a **Rule-Based Algorithm** to calculate a risk score (0-100%). It categorizes patients into Low, Moderate, or High risk and suggests potential symptoms.

**Key Features:**
- 🏥 **Dynamic Input Handling:** Validates user data to prevent crashes.
- 🧮 **Weighted Scoring System:** Assigns different risk weights to age, smoking, and vitals.
- ⚡ **Instant Analysis:** Provides immediate feedback without external API latency.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Concepts Used:** Dictionaries, Exception Handling (`try/except`), Conditional Logic.

## 💻 How to Run
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GaneshNair007/first-project.git
